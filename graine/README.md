# Graine

Prototype of a secure closed-loop evolutionary patching system.

This repository provides a skeleton implementation following a restricted DSL
and security-focused architecture. Many components are placeholders and require
further development.

## Objective

Graine explores how software can evolve through strictly controlled patches
while remaining verifiable and deterministic. The project aims to provide a
research platform for secure closed-loop patch generation and evaluation.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install it in editable mode:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd graine
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

The package is a skeleton and exposes no runtime interface yet. You can import
the module in Python to experiment with extensions:

```python
import graine
```

Future revisions will include command-line tools for patch tournaments and
analysis.

## Limitations

- Many components are placeholders and must be implemented before production
  use.
- The environment is intentionally sandboxed: no network, subprocesses, or FFI.
- Only repository files are accessible; external resources are not supported.
