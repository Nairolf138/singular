# Governance

## Decision Making

Contributions are accepted through pull requests. Changes require review by at
least one maintainer and successful automated validation.

Meta-rules are adopted only after validation and phantom tournaments.
Constitutional constraints are immutable.

## Roles and Responsibilities

Maintainers curate the roadmap and arbitrate disputes. Community contributors
propose patches and participate in reviews.

## Amendment Process

Amendments to this document follow the same review process as code changes and
must preserve the constitutional constraints.
